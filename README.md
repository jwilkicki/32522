# 32522

## Current behavior

Renovate generates a PR for the calico-application.yaml but not the externaldns-application.yaml in the argocd/code/templates directory.

## Expected behavior

The expected behavior is for Renovate to generate a PR for both the `calico-application.yaml` and `externaldns-application.yaml` files in the `argocd/code/templates` directory.
